# WebView2 Plugin Documentation

To view this documentation within your Rainmeter skin, point your WebView2 measure's `URL` option to the local file path of `index.html`. For example, if your skin structure places this folder in `@Resources`, use `URL=#@#docs\index.html`. Since the documentation uses relative paths and no external dependencies, it will load instantly and function fully offline. Ensure `IsScriptEnabled` is set to `1` in your measure settings to allow the search functionality to work.
